// Completed
    - Visualization.
    - Class Colors can be changed.
    - Add a boolean value in each gui, to display the current class or not.
    - Add a open file button and then open file using that button. 
    - Add a new field in GUI Dat to input color via typing hex value of the color.

// To DO
    - Push the states of GUI Dat in Global states. Create a single copy of GUI dat and refactor the code into two parts :
        - Controller
        - Visualization
        - Set up initial global classes and fix the color of each class. 
    - Add a mechanism to display the fields in csv file as layers.
        - The layers present in the file should be displayed as widgets, where the user has the choice to display the chosen label.
